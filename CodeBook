GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT

Codebook Description (adapted from course material)

The data included here resulted from experiments involving a group of 30 volunteers with ages between 19 and 48 years old. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying) wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on his or her waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, researchers captured triaxial linear acceleration and triaxial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The resulting dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% for the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows to generate the data included in this project. 

The variables 1-3 are identifiers to illustrate which group each record belongs to:

 [1] "Group" - Indicates whether subject was in test or training group
 [2] "Subj.ID" - unique numerical identifier for each test subject      
 [3] "Activity" - one of six activities

The variables 4-89 capture the following performance data:
- Mean and standard deviation of Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Mean and standard deviation of Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- These variables are classified according to whether the acceleration/angular velocity is attributable to gravity or the body, and whether the measurements occur along the X, Y, or Z axis
